00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.604
We are now going to demonstrate how to build a binary

2
00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:07.115
RPM package from the source RPM.

3
00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:11.830
First, on a CentOS system and then on an openSUSE system.

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.200
Both of which are based on the Red Hat package manager.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.270
So first, we need to obtain the source RPM.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.730
So, we can do that using "yumdownloader" on CentOS.

7
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.910
And we give the "--source" option and just the name of the package,

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.420
and I'm just arbitrarily picking "gzip".

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.590
And, notice I did not have to be the superuser to do this.

10
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.290
And there it is. It's already been downloaded, it's 732 kilobytes.

11
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.023
And then I only need to type a one-line command.

12
00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:52.313
Once again, I do not have to be root.

13
00:00:52.313 --> 00:01:00.000
"rpmbuild --rebuild", and then I just give the name of the RPM [gzip],

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.260
which downloaded to my current directory.

15
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.100
So, this is configuring and compiling, this takes a while.

16
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.983
It's doing the usual "config" program, that's standard for many tarballs.

17
00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:18.778
So, it'll just take a little while, we'll wait.

18
00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:27.939
Now, we'll see when we go to the SUSE system,

19
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.575
we also will not need to be a superuser.

20
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.090
We can do this as an ordinary user.

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.410
Once again, everything except the final install step.

22
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.140
So now it is done with its work.

23
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.070
So the question is, where did it put it?

24
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.680
Well, in the student's "home" directory, there is now an "rpmbuild" directory.

25
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.000
And, you'll see there is an "RPMS" directory in there.

26
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:06.179
Which has an "/x86_64" subdirectory.

27
00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.161
And there you see it generated two binary RPMs.

28
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:14.350
"gzip" I could install, and then there's also a "gzip-debuginfo",

29
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.061
which is useful when you're doing any kind of debugging, 

30
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:23.336
because it contains the entire symbol table for the "gzip" program.

31
00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:29.000
So, let's pause for a second while we fire up the openSUSE virtual machine,

32
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.937
and then do the similar operations there.

33
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:35.982
We are going to do the similar operation on an openSUSE system.

34
00:02:35.982 --> 00:02:39.570
So, the first thing we have to do is to obtain the source package.

35
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.085
So, we're going to obtain a very simple package called "gup".

36
00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:50.440
And while we could probably find some command line program to do this,

37
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.951
I was not so successful in finding that easily,

38
00:02:53.951 --> 00:03:00.365
so I simply went to the openSUSE website and found where the source was installed.

39
00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:05.013
And here's the complete line I'm using to download it, with "wget".

40
00:03:05.013 --> 00:03:09.790
It's a very small package, and then it's the same kind of command.

41
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.315
All I have to do is say "rpmbuild".

42
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:22.505
And then I just give the name of a package:

43
00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:28.889
"gup-0.3*", should be there.

44
00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:36.747
I'm sorry, I left out the "--rebuild" option.

45
00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:40.270
There you go.

46
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.630
So, it's doing the same thing as we had before.

47
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.900
And once again, I have an "rpmbuild" subdirectory.

48
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.570
And, if I look in the "RPMS" directory,

49
00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.000
I see once again an "x86_64", and there's the RPM that we generated.

50
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.670
Notice that by default on openSUSE, you do not get the debug info.

51
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.860
I have to specify some other options to get that RPM as well.

52
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.480
So basically the operation is the same on both systems.

53
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.496
For neither one do I have to be a superuser.

54
00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:23.163
To generate the binary RPM, I will only need it to install.
