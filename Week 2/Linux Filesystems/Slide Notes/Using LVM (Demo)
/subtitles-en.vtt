00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.960
Let's get some practice examining our LVM setup,

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.400
and doing things like creating a new logical volume, and

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.485
putting a filesystem on it, etc.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.080
So first, let's see what physical volumes are in use in our system.

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.040
And we can do that with:

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.036
"sudo pvdisplay | grep sd".

7
00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:32.011
And you'll see, these are the different hard disk partitions

8
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:38.460
which are being used as physical volumes, and being used in the volume groups.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.720
So, we see that we have both "sdb" and "sda".

10
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.680
On this system, "sda" is an old-fashioned rotational hard disk.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.990
"sdb", as in "SSD", which is much faster, so

12
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.170
we try to put high-performance sensitive data on "sdb".

13
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.340
If I just type "sudo pvdisplay", just looking at "sd",

14
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
I get information about each volume on the system.

15
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.860
So, you'll see exactly how big each one is.

16
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.110
For instance, "sda2" is 500 gigabytes in size.

17
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.132
And the extents, or the units in which the physical volume

18
00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:23.010
is trunked up are 4 megabytes, which is what's called a "PE".

19
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.600
If I want to see what volumes are on the system, I can do "sudo vgdisplay",

20
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.752
and once again, just to get a quick idea, I'll say "Name".

21
00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:39.140
And you'll see, there are volume groups "VG" and "VG2".

22
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.890
And then, I can get more information if I just do "sudo vgdisplay".

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.089
And so, you see "VG2", for instance,

24
00:01:52.089 --> 00:02:01.270
currently has 426 gigabytes free, out of a total of 1.05 terabytes on that disk.

25
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.013
If I want to see what logical volumes I have on my system,

26
00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:14.799
I could do "sudo lvdisplay", and I can grep that with "Path".

27
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.580
And those are the different logical volumes that are on the system.

28
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.686
If I just try "sudo lvdisplay",

29
00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:32.560
I get details about each logical volume that's on the system.

30
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.780
So I notice, I left from a previous attempt,

31
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.930
"newLV" which is I want to create in here, so let me get rid of that first.

32
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:51.267
So I do "sudo lvremove /dev/VG2/newLV".

33
00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:54.257
And it's asking me whether I really want to do that,

34
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.750
and I'll say "yes".

35
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.840
And it's removed.

36
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.436
So, let's go through the process though of recreating it.

37
00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:06.082
So, I'll do "sudo lvcreate -L 4G",

38
00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:09.750
I want it to be 4 gigabytes in size.

39
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.625
I want the name to be "newLV".

40
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.921
And I'm going to put it in "VG2".

41
00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:19.984
So that's created, but it's not really usable yet,

42
00:03:19.984 --> 00:03:22.500
unless I put a filesystem on it.

43
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.528
So, I'll do "sudo mkfs", and

44
00:03:26.528 --> 00:03:29.460
let's just make it an "ext4" filesystem,

45
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.853
"/dev/VG2/newLV".

46
00:03:35.853 --> 00:03:38.612
And it's writing our new filesystem on there.

47
00:03:38.612 --> 00:03:41.959
And then I can mount it and use it, etc.

48
00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.930
So, let me just mount it,

49
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.687
"sudo mount /dev/VG2/newLV",

50
00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:55.791
and I'll put that on "/mnt".

51
00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:01.350
And I can verify it's really there.

52
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.880
And you'll see at the bottom here it's 3.9 gigabyte and

53
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.750
only 16 megabytes are actually used at the moment.

54
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:20.852
And then finally, let me remove it, "sudo lvremove /dev/VG2/newLV".

55
00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:24.940
I didn't unmount it first, so

56
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.360
it won't let me remove it, so the system is being smart.

57
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.230
So, I'll do "sudo umount /mnt", and then I'll try to remove it again.

58
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.144
It says, do you really want to do it?

59
00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:39.820
And I say "yes".

60
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.800
So that's basic commands for manipulating logical volumes on the LVM system.
