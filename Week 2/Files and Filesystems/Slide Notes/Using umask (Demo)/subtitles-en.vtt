00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.270
Let's get some experience with understanding what "umask" does.

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.050
So, to see what the default "umask" is on your account,

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.845
just type "umask", and we see it's "0002".

4
00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, if we didn't have a "mask" set when we created a file,

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.065
it would be created with "666" permission. So, that is 

6
00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.470
read-write permission

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.895
for user, group, and other, or world.

8
00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:34.110
So, let's make a file and see what it looks like.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.620
So, let me remove it in case it's there.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.175
We're going to do this a few times.

11
00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:47.950
"rm -f afile ; touch afile ; ls -l afile".

12
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.120
So, you see the permissions are: 

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.775
"-rw-rw-r--".

14
00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:57.645
So, the two there, they knocked out the write permission on other,

15
00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:59.990
because it's the last field there.

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.150
Likewise, if I did "touch",

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.620
let's change the "umask",

18
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.065
let's say "umask 0022",

19
00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:12.895
it should remove write permission from group now.

20
00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:15.675
So, let's create the file and look at it again.

21
00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.695
You see, that is exactly what it did.

22
00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:21.215
It's "-rw-r--r--".

23
00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:21.995
Now, you can also do this

24
00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.130
in symbolic forms.

25
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.655
So, I could do, for instance, "umask -S",

26
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.370
and you see, it's telling me,

27
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.885
"u=rwx", "g=rx", and "o=rx".

28
00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:39.010
We are not getting any execute permissions on the files,

29
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.365
because the default "mask" that files are created with, is "666", not "777".

30
00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:50.290
And I can also change the "umask" by specifying it

31
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.875
in that more complicated format like,

32
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:54.700
that we use for change mods.

33
00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.670
So, I could do "umask", and I could say, "u=r",

34
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.940
"g=w", "o=rw", let's say.

35
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.790
And then I look at the "mask" again.

36
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.200
And the new files created exactly that: user read-only,

37
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.940
group write-only, and owner read-write.

38
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.670
So, that's a little bit of explanation of how you can play with "umask".
