# Linux Tools for Developers by The Linux Foundation

#### Instructor(s) : Jerry Cooperstein

## About this Course

Course 3 is a continuation of the previous course, and will focus on teaching you how to work with tools you need to do your everyday work. The course begins by introducing you to numerous essential command line tools that are used daily. Then, it focuses on bash scripting - you will learn how to construct scripts and how to do very complicated tasks in an automated way. The course looks at files and filesystems and focuses on compiling programs in Linux, using gcc and other compilers, and using libraries of different types. It also takes a look at how Java works in Linux, and explains why there is no reason to worry about having easy-to-use Java programs in Linux. Course 3 ends by covering building packages out of software in Linux.

## Syllabus

### WEEK 1

#### COMMAND LINE TOOLS

##### Key Concepts

* Identify the basic utility programs for listing, creating, renaming files and other basic file operations
* Use find to locate files in given locations, and locate to find files throughout the system
* Use grep to identify lines in files which contain certain strings and sed to edit files in a streaming fashion
* Display and append to file contents using cat and echo
* Edit and print file contents using sed and awk, and learn to use multiple other utilities for file and text manipulation
* Execute bash scripts and specify arguments that they operate on, and how to use debugging options
* Use looping and conditional constructs in multiple ways, and learn the case switching construct
* Run tests on file properties, string comparisons, and arithmetic expressions, and learn how to use functions (subprograms) inside scripts

### WEEK 2

#### FILES AND FILESYSTEMS

##### Key Concepts

* Enumerate the different kinds of files and file-like objects on the system and use the file program to identify type
* Set permissions and access rights on files and directories using chmod, change ownership with chown, and use umask
* Explain the role of the virtual filesystem (VFS) and how Linux uses it to deploy a vast array of choices
* Describe the native Linux filesystems in the ext(2,3,4) family, and the role of journaling filesystems, including ext3, ext4, xfs, jfs, and btrfs
* Mount filesystems at any time or at boot
* Explain the use of Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) and logical volume management (LVM)

### WEEK 3

#### LINUX DEVELOPER METHODS

##### Key Concepts

* Know the proper methods of compiling libraries and applications using gcc
* Understand the difference between shared and static libraries and how to work with each kind
* Work with gdb, the universal debugger on Linux systems
* Discuss how Java works on Linux systems and what choices are available
* Explain how RPM and Debian packages are created by developers
