00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Let's get started on using the "sed" commands.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.700
To create a new file,

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.835
test1 at the command prompt, type:

4
00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:12.975
"cat > test1", and press Enter.

5
00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.465
Type the following sentences:

6
00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.440
"This is a Sample Test File [that is used] for the "sed" command.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.040
The sed command is used to edit contents in a file.

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.120
For example, the sed command is used to replace words in a line or file.",

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.845
and press the Enter key,

10
00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:35.270
and press Ctrl+D to save the file.

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.690
You will return to the command prompt.

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:49.540
To substitute first string occurrence in a line, type: "sed s/is/are/ test1",

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.570
and press the Enter key.

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.265
The first occurrence of the word "is",

15
00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:58.125
is replaced with "are".

16
00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.119
To view the file test1, type:

17
00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:05.775
"cat test1", and press the Enter key.

18
00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:08.835
The file test1 is displayed at the command prompt.

19
00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.430
The contents of test1 are not altered,

20
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.615
because we don't save the results of the "sed" command.

21
00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:18.330
To substitute string occurrence globally on a range of lines, type:

22
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:35.730
"sed 1,2s/is/are/g test1",

23
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.640
and press the Enter key.

24
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.050
All occurrences of the word "is"

25
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.330
between line one and two are replaced with "are".

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:54.345

To substitute string occurrence globally, type:

31
00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:21.925
"sed s/is/are/g test1",

32
00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:24.130
and press the Enter key.

33
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.990
All occurrences of the word "is"

34
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.605
in the file test1,

35
00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.555

40
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.670
because we don't save the results of the "sed" command.
